For ease of access to the api: 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/displacement/1/1/1
http://127.0.0.1:3000/velocity/1/1/1
http://127.0.0.1:3000/kinetic-energy/1/1
http://127.0.0.1:3000/gravitational-potential/1/1

Short comings:
I was unable to get the api and front end to communicate at all.
When i attempted to pass the url to fetch method it would come back 
with nothing.
